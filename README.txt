The Teensy Fan Controller was a prototype PWM Controller in a small form factor intended to be a Fume Extractor. It used with two 12V fans wired in parallel and a 12VDC power supply to control the speed of the fans as needed. 

Code is provided by David A. Mellis  <dam@mellis.org>, curtesy of Arduino.cc tutorials. This example code is in the public domain. Simply manipulate this example to run a fan instead of an LED.

Now that this is completed, this prototype is no longer supported. The code and schematic uploaded are purely for educational purposes only and are not intended for any commercial venture.
